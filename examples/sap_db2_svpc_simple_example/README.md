# SAP DB2 SVPC Simple Example

This example illustrates how to use the `SAP DB2 SVPC` submodule to deploy SAP HANA on GCP.

## Requirements
Make sure you go through this [Requirements section](../../modules/sap_db2/README.md#requirements) for the SAP DB2 SVPC Submodule.

## Setup

1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` in this directory or the directory where you're running this example.
2. Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` content into the `terraform.tfvars` file and update the contents to match your environment.

## Running the example

To provision this example, run the following from within this directory:
- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure


## Integration Tests


### Additonal setup
If you need to run integration tests make sure to go through these additional setup steps.


#### Additional APIs
 A project with the additional following APIs enabled must be used to host the
resources of this module:

- Google Cloud Storage JSON API: `storage-api.googleapis.com`


#### Additional Service Account Permissions
If you need to run integration tests, the service for deploying resources needs the following additional permissions:

- Storage Admin: `roles/storage.admin`

The [IAM module][iam-module] may be used in to provision a
service account with the necessary roles applied.

 However, for a quick setup, you can use the following gcloud commands:
   `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project-id> --member=serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role=roles/storage.admin`

### Running integration tests

Refer to the [contributing guidelines' Integration Testing Section](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#integration-test) for running integration tests for this example.
