# SAP HANA ScaleOut SVPC Submodule

This module deals with SAP HANA ScaleOut SVPC configuration and deployment.

## Usage

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- Create a Master Node and multiple Worker Nodes that will host SAP HANA Scaleout Module
- Create a Static IP Address for each of the Compute Instance
- Create 2 Persistent Disks on each node to host SAP HANA Scaleout's File systems


You can go in the [examples](../../examples) folder complete working example. However, here's an example of how to use the module in a main.tf file.

```hcl

module "gcp_sap_hana_scaleout_svpc" {
  source                     = "terraform-google-modules/sap/google/sap_hana_scaleout_svpc"
  post_deployment_script     = "${var.post_deployment_script}"
  subnetwork                 = "${var.subnetwork}"
  linux_image_family         = "${var.linux_image_family}"
  linux_image_project        = "${var.linux_image_project}"

  sap_deployment_debug       = "false"
  sap_hana_deployment_bucket = "${var.sap_hana_deployment_bucket}"
  sap_hana_sid               = "${var.sap_hana_sid}"
  sap_hana_instance_number   = "${var.sap_hana_instance_number}"
  sap_hana_sidadm_password   = "${var.sap_hana_sidadm_password}"
  sap_hana_system_password   = "${var.sap_hana_system_password}"
  sap_hana_sidadm_uid        = 900
  sap_hana_sapsys_gid        = 900
  sap_hana_scaleout_nodes    = "${var.sap_hana_scaleout_nodes}"
  zone                       = "${var.zone}"
  instance_count_master      = "${var.instance_count_master}"
  instance_count_worker      = "${var.instance_count_worker}"
  instance_name              = "${var.instance_name}"
  public_ip                  = "${var.public_ip}"
}
```
## Requirements

Make sure you've gone through the root [Requirement Section](../../README.md#requirements)

### SAP HANA Software
 Follow instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/sap-hana-deployment-guide#creating_a_cloud_storage_bucket_for_the_sap_hana_installation_files) to properly Download SAP HANA from the SAP Marketplace, and upload it to a GCS bucket.


### Configure Service Account for identifying the Compute instances
The compute instances created by this submodule will need to download SAP HANA from a GCS bucket in order install it. Follow the instructions below to ensure a successful installation:

 1. [Create a new service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
 2. Grant this new service account the following permissions on the bucket where you uploaded SAP HANA installation file:
    - roles/storage.objectViewer

 You may use the following gcloud commands:
   `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project-id> --member=serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role=roles/storage.objectViewer`

3. When configuring the module, use this newly created service account's email, to set the `service_account_email` input variable.

### Post deployment script
If you need to run a post deployment script, the script needs to be accessible via a **https:// or gs:// URl**.
It is the recommended way is to use a GCS Bucket in the following way.:

1. Upload the SAP HANA software to a GCS bucket.
2. Make sure the service account attached to the instance has the following permissions on the bucket:
   - roles/storage.objectViewer
     - Note that this permission should already be granted if the bucket is in the same project as the one where you created the service account previously.

3. Set the post_deployment_script input to the gs:// link to your script. (i.e gs://<bucket_name>/<my_script>)
